# ansible-home

This is probably totally un-idiomatic Ansible. Ideally, these playbooks will only install stuff, configuration lives in my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/craigfurman/home).

## Todo
* All the things in my drive doc.
* Latest home repo should be synced every time
* Google music manager
