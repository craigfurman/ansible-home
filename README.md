# ansible-home

This is probably totally un-idiomatic Ansible. Ideally, these playbooks will only install stuff, configuration lives in my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/craigfurman/home).

## Todo
* All the things in my drive doc.
* Latest home repo should be synced every time
* Google music manager (https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-musicmanager-beta_current_amd64.deb)
* vagrant-vbox-snapshot Vagrant plugin
* base16 instead of gnome-monokai?
