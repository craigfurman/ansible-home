# ansible-home

Currently moving from Ubuntu to Arch.

## Known limitations

1. Didn't attempt to install google-musicmanager from AUR due to having to build qtwebkit in a clean chroot, which takes over an hour. Leaving this as a manual step.

## To do

1. AUR packages
1. Config: zsh, vim

## First run
1. `bash -c "$(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/craigfurman/ansible-home/master/bootstrap.sh)"`
1. Check limitations section
1. In tmux, prefix+I to install plugins.
1. `~/.vim/update`

## Subsequent runs
1. `run.sh`
