# ansible-home

This is probably totally un-idiomatic Ansible. Ideally, these playbooks will only install stuff, configuration lives in my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/craigfurman/home).

Todo:
* A lot.

Laptop only:
* tlp for power management
* xbacklight and custom shortcuts for screen brightness
